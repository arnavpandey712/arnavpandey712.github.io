Hello there! I completed my bachelor's degree (B.Tech) in Mechanical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur in 2024. During my undergraduate studies, my academic and research experiences included: (1) Developing a shape-memory alloy powered variable stiffness actuator, for which, I also explored and modelled a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based
control and reinforcement learning framework, (2) Building a vine-like soft robot for rescue operations of children fallen inside borewells, and (3) I worked as a senior technical member of the Team AUV-IITK; I integrated the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) navigation algorithms for the underwater vehicle- Anahita, which now competes in competitions like Singapore
AUV Challenge (SAUVC) and RoboSub, Sandiego, USA. I also served as the General Secretarty, Science and Techonology, which is the  elected representative of 8000+ students responsible for overseeing technical activities across clubs and societies.

Currently, I am working as a software engineer at Cisco Systems Inc.- Bengaluru, India office. I contribute to the cloud infrastructure powering real-time data pipelines for intelligent systems used in localization through Wi-Fi and Meraki camera feeds for indoor navigation, asset tracking, and mapping. I designed a “Snooker Ball Tracking System” using computer vision,
Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) feeds, and Arduino-based laser actuation, which won the global Cisco-wide HackAIthon 2024. It involved developing a real-time object detection system to automate the &quot;Foul and Play&quot; rule enforcement, with a custom dataset and a Meraki-integrated model. I applied homography for real-world projection, reducing decision latency by 95%
