This IoT-based wearable health monitoring system represents a comprehensive solution for continuous patient care, featuring a wrist-worn device that simultaneously tracks six critical vital parameters—SpO2, pulse rate, blood pressure, ECG, respiratory rate, and body temperature—through integrated MAX32664D, AD8232, and flex/temperature sensors.<br/><br/><img src='/images/dummy_with _sensors.png'> <br/><br/> The system leverages an ESP32 Wi-Fi module to transmit sensor data to a cloud-powered health analytics pipeline that computes dynamic risk scores using a rules-based threshold model and triggers push notifications on a companion mobile app to alert doctors and caregivers during medical emergencies. Built with a multi-layered data privacy and security architecture incorporating RSA-based end-to-end encryption, AES-256 server-side encryption, and blockchain-based decentralized access logging, the platform ensures tamper-proof storage and controlled retrieval of sensitive patient health records.<br/><br/><img src='/images/data_flow_brahma.png'> <br/><br/> The system includes robust fail-safe mechanisms such as on-device buzzers, LED indicators, and offline data caching to maintain functionality during power outages, network loss, or sensor malfunctions, while advanced anomaly detection algorithms identify and report faulty sensor data in real time. Additionally, the platform integrates LSTM-based deep recurrent neural networks trained on time-series patient vitals to enable early detection of health deterioration, creating a proactive Early Warning System (EWS) that notifies medical staff before critical thresholds are crossed.<br/>
