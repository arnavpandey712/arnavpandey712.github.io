Tired of attending daily stand-up meetings? This custom Alexa skill, named **TaskLogger**, is designed to act as a voice-enabled scrum assistant. Team members can log their updates vocally, and others can retrieve them on demand—making team coordination more flexible and asynchronous.The skill was developed using the **Alexa Skills Kit (ASK)** and is hosted on **AWS Lambda**. It uses Python scripts to handle intents triggered by wake words and utterances. The interaction model—comprising locales and slots—is easily customizable to adapt to different team structures and workflows. A demo video is available below.<br/><br/>

These include **Total Sessions**, **Average Sessions per User**, **Session Type Distribution**, and **Successful Session Completion Rates**, offering valuable insight into team engagement and Alexa usage patterns.
