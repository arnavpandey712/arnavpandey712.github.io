This adaptive robotic actuator project features a prototype based on the Mechanically Adjustable Compliance and Controllable Equilibrium Position Actuator (MACCEPA) framework, designed for safe and adaptable robotic joint articulation. <br/><br/><img src='/images/setup.png'> <br/><br/> The system incorporates comprehensive analysis of Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) spring weight-bearing characteristics through Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) trained on displacement data acquired from laser-based deflection sensing, enabling accurate performance prediction under varying thermal and load conditions.<br/><br/><img src='/images/graph.png'> <br/><br/>A sophisticated control framework utilizes recurrent Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to model the nonlinear, time-dependent behavior of the actuator under fluctuating inputs and temperature dynamics, while a real-time deflection-sensing system with embedded microcontroller (Arduino) and rotary encoder provides continuous feedback on actuator deformation. The project advances adaptive control capabilities by implementing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) within a reinforcement learning framework, effectively achieving adaptive control of Shape-Memory Alloy (SMA) actuators under complex biased loading scenarios and resulting in enhanced system robustness and learning-driven motion control.<br/>
