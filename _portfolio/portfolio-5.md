This vine-like soft robot represents an innovative rescue solution specifically designed for retrieving children from borewell accidents, utilizing biomimetic growth strategies and continuum navigation principles to maneuver through confined vertical shafts. The project was informed by comprehensive analysis of over 15 research papers on soft actuation, fluidic artificial muscles, and bioinspired robotics to optimize actuator design, material selection, and structural compliance strategies for the challenging rescue environment.

The system features a soft continuum manipulator with pneumatically-actuated segments and a compliant gripper, controlled through air compressors, solenoid valves, and pneumatic regulators to achieve precise movement and safe child retrieval. Integration of sensors and actuators is managed through an Arduino Mega platform interfacing with HC-05 Bluetooth modules, pressure sensors, accelerometers, temperature/humidity sensors, relays, and motor drivers to enable comprehensive environmental monitoring and control. The robot's performance was validated through inverse kinematics simulations of the multi-end-effector soft robot system, analyzing reachable workspace parameters, deformation behavior characteristics, and control precision optimization under pneumatic actuation conditions.
